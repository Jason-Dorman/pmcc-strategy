"""Design tokens — the single source of visual truth (FR-8, AD-6).

Every colour, font stack, size and layout default the site uses lives here. Nothing else
in the codebase may contain a hex value or a font name: that is FR-8's acceptance test and
it is mechanical, so `tests/test_theme.py` enforces it by grepping the other modules.

Imports nothing project-local, by design (SYSTEM-SPEC §4) — `theme` sits at the bottom of
the dependency graph so both the Plotly builders and the Reflex components can consume it
without a cycle.

The identity
------------
Deep-navy ground, **amber terminal type**, and a dense tiled layout. The Bloomberg reference
is about *arrangement* — numbered panels butted against each other under one command bar,
no floating cards, no scroll of whitespace — and the amber is the type colour that goes with
it. See DESIGN-BRIEF.md §1.

Two of the encodings are not ours to choose — the assignment brief fixes them:

    cyan   = the mark      (README: "Cyan: SETTLE")
    magenta = the print    (README: "Magenta diamonds: TRDPRC_1")

`ACCENT` (amber) is therefore type and chrome only: headings, metric values, panel numbers,
the as-of slider. It never encodes data. Keeping the brand colour out of the data channel is
what lets the page's one argument — the mark is not the print — read at a glance. Puts take
the hues furthest from their own call — violet for the mark, green for the print — with the
glyph fixed by role, so a four-series view stays legible without either right stealing the
other's hue.

Everything is named for its job, not its colour (`MARK`, not `CYAN`): the point of the
indirection is that re-toning the site is a change of values here, not a change of call
sites anywhere.

#   mark   cyan #22E3D0 (calls)  /  violet #A78BFA (puts)   — 83 deg apart
#   print  magenta #FF2E88 (calls) / green #3DDC84 (puts)   — 150 deg apart
#
# Separation is largest *within* a role, which is the comparison the page is actually asking
# a reader to make — and since the glyph is fixed by role, hue is the only channel telling
# the two rights apart, so it has to do the work alone. Amber stays out of the data channel.

# ------------------------------------------------- Assignment 2: the covered-call page
#
# Chosen FROM the palette rather than added to it, and that is a finding rather than a
# preference: every hue the wheel has left sits within ~35 deg of the amber (which is type,
# not data) or within ~40 deg of a locked series hue, so a "new" colour here would be a
# near-shade of something that already means something. DESIGN-BRIEF §9.
#
# **NAV is a series; IM and MM are rulers.** The question that panel answers is not "what are
# these three quantities" but "does NAV stay above them" — IM and MM are *requirements*
# computed off LMV, not measurements of the strategy. So §6 rule 6 applies exactly as it does
# to FR-12's spot plane: a reference wears no series hue and no amber, and stays subordinate.
# Here it is subordinate by weight and dash rather than by opacity — a line has no area to fog
# what is behind it, so translucency would only make it hard to see.
#
# NAV takes violet rather than the cyan its 10.3:1 would argue for (PO, 2026-09-17), because
# panel [5] of this same page is the mid-vs-print scatter: cyan and magenta are spoken for
# HERE by the README's own encoding, and a hue that means "the mark" in one panel must not
# mean "the account" two panels down. Violet has no job on this page — a covered call has no
# puts in it.
#
# Written as values, not as aliases of `MARK_PUT` / `SPOT_PLANE` / `NEUTRAL`, which they
# currently match. The match is deliberate — one palette, roles reused — but the *coupling*
# is not: re-toning 1.1's puts must not move Assignment 2's NAV line. `IDENTITY_LINE` below
# is the one genuine alias, and for the opposite reason.

MARGIN_MM = "#6E8CB8"     # maintenance margin, 25% — the margin-call line, fainter still

# The ladder is read in three channels at once (hue, weight, dash), so no single one of them
# has to carry it alone. That is what lets NAV sit 43 deg from the rulers — closer than the
# 60 deg floor the four 1.1 series must clear, which is a floor for 4px markers separated by
# hue ALONE. The hero already accepts this exact gap between the spot plane and the violet

# and the daily ledger. A table gets the same posture a figure got in T-47 — **it scrolls
# rather than deforming**. Four columns of dollars squeezed until the decimals no longer line
# up is the table version of "the chart is broken", and a horizontal scrollbar is the honest
# alternative (AD-9's posture, applied to layout).
#
# 720 is the widest of the four tables' honest minimum — the ledger's thirteen columns — and
# it is applied to all of them, so a reader never meets two different table behaviours on one
# page. The strategy table is two columns of key and value and opts out (`.osl-table-kv`):
# giving it a 720px floor would put a scrollbar under a table that fits.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------- HTML / Reflex
#
# The same tokens, shaped for the two non-Plotly consumers: the Reflex page's component
# props and the static builder's inline styles. Both render the identical panel chrome, so
# the checkpoint demo and the graded page look like one product.

# The Reflex page used to restate the panel chrome here as component props while the static
# builder used the classes below. Two spellings of one design is how the published page once
# shipped with the hero one column wide while `reflex run` looked perfect -- and, later, how
# the Reflex app ended up with no responsive breakpoints at all. Both pages now render the
# same class names against PAGE_CSS, so these props are gone (T-47).

# Every width from 1..GRID_COLUMNS gets a class, generated rather than listed. Hand-listing
# them is how the published page broke on 2026-09-02: the hero split moved from 7/3 to 6/4,
# the tokens were updated and the stylesheet was not, so `.osl-w6` and `.osl-w4` did not
# exist and both panels silently fell back to one column. The Reflex app styles its panels
# inline, so it kept working — the defect only ever appeared on the deployed page.
